**IF YOU WANT TO ADD A SITE, FOLLOW THESE STEPS**

1. Pick which section your site belongs in, pick a spot and type a asterisk * followed by a space. Now type the name of your site in brackets []
2. Next use tinyurl.com to make your url short and put your tinyurl url in parenthesis () followed by a space then a dash - then a space again and finally more parenthesis ()
3. In the parenthesis, note what types of content the site has (Movies, TV, Anime, only note cartoons if it's a cartoon exclusive site, or a site that has only anime and cartoons) 
4. Note what player the site uses. JW Player (vidcloud,) Openload, RapidVideo, Google Server, OK.RU or whatever it is. If a site uses multple types of players use "mixed servers." If the site hosts the videos themselves use "dedicated server." 
5. Note how big the library of the site is. Small, Medium, Big or Huge. Check this by seeing if a site has obscure content. Just try to give your best judgement. 
6. If it's a anime or cartoon only site, please note the quality of video. (1080p or 720p, any lower and don't note)
7. If it's a android apk, please note the quality of video. (1080p or 720p, any lower and don't note) + Note if apk uses chromecast.
