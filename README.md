If you'd like to suggest a site you can use the reddit [suggestions post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/comments/ccrmsv/changelog_plans_suggestions/) If you'd rather submit the site manually please follow the steps below.

1. Change url via [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/)
2. Note what types of content the site has (Movies, TV, Anime, only note cartoons if it's a cartoon exclusive, or anime/cartoon exclusive site) 
3. Note what player the site uses. If a site uses multiple types of players use "mixed servers." If the site hosts the videos themselves use "dedicated server." 
4. Note the size of the sites library. Small, Medium, Big or Huge. Just try to give your best judgement. 
5. Note the quality of the sites content. (1080p, 720p or SD) If a site is mostly SD but some HD do SD/HD

For sites that don't list quality, check manually using video download [addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/)
