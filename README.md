If you'd like to suggest a site you can use the reddit [suggestions post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/comments/ccrmsv/changelog_plans_suggestions/) If you'd rather submit the site manually please follow the steps below.

1. Change url via [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/)
2. Copy this to your spot in the post * [Site Name](tinyurl link) - () 
3. In the empty parenthesis, note what types of content the site has (Movies, TV, Anime, only note cartoons if it's a cartoon exclusive, or anime/cartoon exclusive site) 
4. Note what player the site uses. JW Player, Openload, RapidVideo, Google Server, OK.RU, NetU Player or whatever it is. If a site uses multiple types of players use "mixed servers." If the site hosts the videos themselves use "dedicated server." 
5. Note the size of the sites library. Small, Medium, Big or Huge. Check this by seeing if a site has obscure content. Just try to give your best judgement. 
6. Note the quality of the sites content. (1080p, 720p or SD) If a site is mostly SD but some HD do SD/HD

For sites that don't list quality, check manually using video download [addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/)

 You can make a site bold by adding ** ** around the sites name
